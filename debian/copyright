This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-deoptimr package of DEoptimR.  The
DEoptimR package provides an R-only implementation of the jDE variant
of Differential Evolution algorithm in pure R, and was written by
Eduardo L. T. Conceicao and Martin Maechler.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from the main CRAN site
	http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/
and are also available from all CRAN mirrors as e.g.
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'DEoptimR' to
'r-cran-deoptimr' to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages
for R.
